# virool_challenges

The coding challenge I was sent seemed to have trouble with the format of fetching data from the document.
I went ahead and recreated the challenges here. As you can see they are much more interactive as they take direct input from the user.

Go ahead and give it a shot!

# Instructions:

* Fork/Clone this repository to your local machine

#Thank you for taking the time to look at this!
